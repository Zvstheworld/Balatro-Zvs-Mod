# Balatro: Zvs Mod
A fun Balatro mod made by Zvs. To use, you will need Steamodded, Lovely Injector, and knowledge on how to add mods. This has:

- 20+ Jokers
- Nothing else so far...

# TO INSTALL:

You, of course, need Steamodded and Lovely. Go to your mods folder (type %AppData%/Balatro into the File Explorer search bar on Windows) and insert the ZvsModPack file from the zip. Inside the file, there should be all the mod content, and NOT another folder.

# WORKS WITH:

- Yahimod (overall fun combo)
- Handy
- Blueprint/Brainstorm

  
# CURRENT VERSION: 1.2

- Added No B*tches? Joker
- Removed Redprint and Green Needle, overall buggy jokers that don't belong. That doesn't mean Blueprint-styled jokers are out the window.
